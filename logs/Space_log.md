The human_play script is working, it loads the spaceship images, however I will need to modify the core module to load it from there.

next I will be working on the environment to train the agents using NEAT.

# LAST DONE:
tried best picke, triend some of the examples of the play_match.py

# NEXT:
add penalty for recieving hits, (keep it minimal)


# Model Notes

1) only rewarded if hit
The Model fires and don't show any interest in dodge the bullets or follow the enemy ship
